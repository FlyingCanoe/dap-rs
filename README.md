# dap-rs

dap-rs is a work in progress library which implements a dap adapter. In the debug adapter protocol, the adapter is the debugger.

The specification of the debug adapter protocol is vague, underspecify. In fact, it is mostly just a json schema, the specification page on the official website is just a lossy rendering of the schema.

As such, my efforts are currently focused on making sense and documenting the idiosyncrasy of the specification.
